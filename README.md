# Supermarket Sales Analysis and Visualization

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing a **Supermarket Sales Dataset** using **Python** and **Power BI**. The dataset contains transactional data, including product categories, customer demographics, payment methods, sales amounts, and timestamps.

## Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python.
- Generate insightful visualizations with **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI**.
- Identify trends, patterns, and key business insights.

## Tools & Libraries
### Python Libraries:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization
- **NumPy**: Numerical analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive charts

### Power BI:
- **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
- **Interactive Dashboards & Reports**

## Analysis Steps
### **Python Analysis**
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handling missing values (if any)
   - Data type conversion
   - Feature engineering (e.g., extracting day, month, and hour from Date/Time)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary statistics (mean, median, mode)
   - Correlation analysis
   - Distribution of numerical features
   - Customer demographics insights

3. **Visualization:**
   - Sales trends over time
   - Best-selling product categories
   - Branch-wise sales performance
   - Gender-based purchasing behavior
   - Payment method distribution
